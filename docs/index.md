I'm struggling a little bit with responsive design in CSS.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GabrielKayque/ChooseYourFighter-Assisted/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GabrielKayque/ChooseYourFighter-Assisted/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
