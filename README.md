## Choose Your Fighter - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is a single page project, so I can practice CSS and JavaScript!!

I'm struggling a little bit with responsive design in CSS.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GabrielKayque/ChooseYourFighter-Assisted/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GabrielKayque/ChooseYourFighter-Assisted/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
